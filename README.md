# Dynamic Audio FX

**Dynamic Audio FX** is a small library of dynamic AudioEffect nodes for Godot 4.4. When added to the scene tree, they automatically create an AudioEffect for an associated bus, and deallocate it upon exiting the tree.

## Features

- Dynamic, run-time configuration of AudioEffects
- Easy way to define audio spaces on a scene-by-scene basis
- 2D and 3D DFX nodes, which mix audio effects depending on visual distance to target or camera
